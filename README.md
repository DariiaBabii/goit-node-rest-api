# User Management API

This project implements a REST API for managing users and contacts, including user registration, login, logout, getting current user data, and securing routes with token-based authentication.

## Features

### 1: User Registration
- Allows new users to register.
- Ensures `email` and `password` are provided.
- Password is salted and hashed using `bcrypt`.

### 2: User Login
- Allows users to log in.
- Validates `email` and `password`.
- Compares entered password with the hashed password in the database.
- Returns a JWT token upon successful login.

### 3: User Logout
- Logs the user out by deleting their token.

### 4: Get Current User Data
- Retrieves the current logged-in userâ€™s data based on the token.

### 5: Token-based Route Protection
- Protects routes by verifying the validity of the token.
